## RBL4D-Var Forecast Cycle Observation Impacts: Exercise 9, Step 3

It sets and runs the **ROMS** Nonlinear model in forecast mode,
initialized with the background circulation at the end of the
**RBL4D-Var** cycle (**EX3_RPCG**) **file wc13_fwd_000.nc** to
compute the **`FCSTB` green curve** trajectory shown in **Figure 1**.

**`Figure 1:`** A schematic of a typical operational analysis-forecast cycle.
During the analysis cycle, an ocean state estimate is computed using
4D-Var to assimilate all available observations. The blue curve represents
the background circulation, **X<sub>b</sub>**, for this cycle and is derived
from the state estimate from the previous **4D-Var** cycle. The number of
time steps during the analysis cycle is given by **NTIMES_ANA**. At the end of
the analysis cycle, there are two possible forecasts: **FCAT** - the red forecast,
which is initialized using the state estimate at the end of the analysis cycle,
and **FCTB** - the green forecast, which extends the 4D-Var background into the
forecast cycle. The number of time steps during the forecast cycle is **NTIMES_FCT**.
These two forecasts can be verified against either a new analysis or against
new observations during the `verification interval`. The red forecast **FCTA** has
benefited from the observations assimilated during the analysis interval, while
the **green** forecast **FCTB** has not. Therefore, the difference in forecast
error between **FCTA** and **FCTB** can be used to quantify the impact of the
observations assimilated during the analysis cycle on the subsequent forecast
skill of **FCTA**.

The **VERIFICATION** option is activated to interpolate the forecast
trajectory at the new observation locations **forecast_obs.nc**. The
nonlinear model values at the observation locations are stored in
**wc13_mod.nc**.

The surface forcing fields are read from **`../FCSTAT/wc13_fwd.nc`**,
**BULK_FLUXES** is NOT activated. This step is necessary because the
**red** and **green** forecasts must be subject to the same
surface and lateral boundary conditions.

### How to Run this Application:

You need to take the following steps:

- Customize your preferred **build** script and provide the
  appropriate values for:

  - Root directory, **MY_ROOT_DIR**
  - **ROMS** source code path, **MY_ROMS_SRC**
  - Fortran compiler, **FORT**
  - MPI flags, **USE_MPI** and **USE_MPIF90**
  - Path of **MPI**, **NetCDF**, and **ARPACK** libraries according to
    the compiler. Notice that you need to provide the
    correct locations of these libraries for your computer.
    If you want to ignore this section, comment (turn off) the
    assignment for the macro **USE_MY_LIBS**.

- Notice that the most important CPP options for this application
  are specified in the **build** script instead of the header file
  **wc13.h** allows flexibility with different CPP options:
  ```
       setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DNLM_DRIVER"
       setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DANA_SPONGE"
       setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DFORWARD_WRITE"
       setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DVERIFICATION"
  ```
  For this to work, however, any **#undef** directives **must** be
  avoided in the header file **wc13.h** since it has precedence
  during C-preprocessing.

  - You **must** use any of the **build** scripts to compile.

- Customize the **ROMS** input script **roms_wc13.in** and specify
  the appropriate values for the distributed-memory tile partition.
  It is set by default to:
  ```
      NtileI == 2                               ! I-direction partition
      NtileJ == 4                               ! J-direction partition
  ```
  Notice that the adjoint-based algorithms can only be run
  in parallel using **MPI**.  This is because of the way that the
  adjoint model is constructed.

- Customize the configuration script **job_fcstb.csh** and provide
  the appropriate place for the **substitute** Perl script:
  ```
      set SUBSTITUTE=${ROMS_ROOT}/ROMS/Bin/substitute
  ```
  This Perl script is distributed with **ROMS**, and it is found in the
  **ROMS/Bin** sub-directory. Alternatively, you can define
  **ROMS_ROOT** environmental variable in your login script. For example, I have:
  ```
     setenv ROMS_ROOT ${HOME}/ocean/repository/git/roms
  ```

- Execute the configuration **job_fcstb.csh** `BEFORE` running
  the model. It copies the required files and creates **rbl4dvar.in**
  input script from template **s4dvar.in**. This has to be done
  EVERY TIME that you run this application. We need a clean and
  fresh copy of the initial conditions and observation files
  since they are modified by **ROMS** during execution.

- Use Matlab script **create_ini_fcstb.m** to create ROMS initial
  conditions from the previous **RBL4D-Var** background solution (**EXE_RPCG**)
  forward file **`../../RBL4DVAR/EX3_RPCG/wc13_fwd_000.nc`**.

- Run nonlinear **ROMS `FCSTA` Red Forecast**:
  ```
      mpirun -np 8 romsM roms_wc13_daily.in > & log &

      or

      mpirun -np 8 romsM roms_wc13_2hours.in > & log &
  ```
