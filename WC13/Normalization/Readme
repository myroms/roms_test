Important Parameters:

Since we are modeling the error covariance matrix, D, we need to
compute the normalization coefficients to ensure that the diagonal
elements of the associated correlation matrix C are equal to unity.
There are two methods to compute normalization coefficients: exact
and randomization (an approximation).

The exact method is very expensive on large grids. The normalization
coefficients are computed by perturbing each model grid cell with a
delta function scaled by the area (2D state variables) or volume
(3D state variables), and then by convolving with the squared-root
adjoint and tangent linear diffusion operators.

The approximated method is cheaper: the normalization coefficients
are computed using the randomization approach of Fisher and Courtier
(1995). The coefficients are initialized with random numbers having
a uniform distribution (drawn from a normal distribution with zero
mean and unit variance). Then, they are scaled by the inverse
squared-root of the cell area (2D state variable) or volume (3D state
variable) and convolved with the squared-root adjoint and tangent
diffusion operators over a specified number of iterations, Nrandom.                      
Check following parameters in the 4D-Var input script "s4dvar.in"
(see input script for details):

      Nmethod  == 0             ! normalization method
      Nrandom  == 5000          ! randomization iterations

      LdefNRM == T T T T        ! Create a new normalization files
      LwrtNRM == T T T T        ! Compute and write normalization

      CnormI(isFsur) =  T       ! 2D variable at RHO-points
      CnormI(isUbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at U-points
      CnormI(isVbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at V-points 
      CnormI(isUvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at U-points
      CnormI(isVvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at V-points
      CnormI(isTvar) =  T T     ! NT tracers

      CnormB(isFsur) =  T       ! 2D variable at RHO-points
      CnormB(isUbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at U-points
      CnormB(isVbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at V-points
      CnormB(isUvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at U-points
      CnormB(isVvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at V-points
      CnormB(isTvar) =  T T     ! NT tracers

      CnormF(isUstr) =  T       ! surface U-momentum stress
      CnormF(isVstr) =  T       ! surface V-momentum stress
      CnormF(isTsur) =  T T     ! NT surface tracers flux

This directory computes the normalization coefficients using the
exact method since this application has a small grid (54x53x30)
and creates the following files:

      wc13_nrm_i.nc             initial conditions
      wc13_nrm_m.nc             model error
      wc13_nrm_b.nc             open boundary conditions
      wc13_nrm_f.nc             surface forcing (wind stress and
                                                 net heat flux)

The normalization coefficients need to be computed only once
for a particular application provided that the grid, land/sea
masking (if any), and decorrelation scales (HdecayI, VdecayI,
HdecayB, VdecayV, and HdecayF) remain the same. Notice that
large spatial changes in the normalization coefficient
structure are observed near the open boundaries and land/sea
masking regions.

To run this application you need to take the following steps:

  (1) We need to run the model application for a period that is
      long enough to compute meaningful circulation statistics,
      like mean and standard deviations for all prognostic state
      variables (zeta, u, v, T, and S). The standard deviations
      are written to NetCDF files and are read by the 4D-Var
      algorithm to convert modeled error correlations to error
      covariances. The error covariance matrix, D, is very large
      and not well known. It is modeled by convolving a diffusion
      equation as in Weaver and Courtier (2001).

      In this application, we need standard deviations for
      initial conditions, surface forcing (ADJUST_WSTRESS and
      ADJUST_STFLUX), and open boundary conditions (ADJUST_BOUNDARY).
      The standard deviations for the initial and open boundary
      conditions are in terms of the unbalanced error covariance
      (K Du K') since the balanced operator is activated
      (BALANCE_OPERATOR and ZETA_ELLIPTIC).

      The balance operator imposes a multivariate constraint on
      the error covariance such that the unobserved variable
      information is extracted from observed data by establishing
      balance relationships (i.e., T-S empirical formulas,
      hydrostactic balance, and geostrophic balance) with other
      state variables (Weaver et al., 2005).
   
      These standard deviations have already been created for you:

      ../Data/wc13_std_m.nc     model error
      ../Data/wc13_std_i.nc     initial conditions
      ../Data/wc13_std_b.nc     open boundary conditions
      ../Data/wc13_std_f.nc     surface forcing (wind stress and
                                                 net heat flux)

      The model error normalization coefficients are computed if
      NADJ < NTIMES in ¨roms_wc13.in¨. In this application,
      NADJ = 48 to force the computation of model error
      normalization coefficients.

      NTIMES == 192
      ...
        NADJ == 48      ! force to compute model error normalization factors
!       NADJ == 192     ! avoid computing  model error normalization factors

  (2) Customize your preferred "build_roms" script and provide the
      appropriate values for:

      * Root directory, MY_ROOT_DIR
      * ROMS source code, MY_ROMS_SRC
      * Fortran compiler, FORT
      * MPI flags, USE_MPI and USE_MPIF90
      * Path of MPI, NetCDF, and ARPACK libraries according to
        the compiler. Notice that you need to provide the
        correct places of these libraries for your computer.
        If you want to ignore this section, comment out the
        assignment for the variable USE_MY_LIBS.

  (3) Notice that the most important CPP option for this application
      is specified in the "build_roms" script instead of "wc13.h":

      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DNORMALIZATION"

      this is to allow flexibility with different CPP options.

      For this to work, however, any "#undef" directives MUST be
      avoided in the header file "wc13.h" since it has precedence
      during C-preprocessing.

  (4) You MUST use the "build_roms" script to compile.

  (5) Customize the ROMS input script "roms_wc13.in" and specify
      the appropriate values for the distributed-memory partition.
      It is set by default to:

      NtileI == 1                               ! I-direction partition
      NtileJ == 8                               ! J-direction partition

      Notice that the adjoint-based algorithms can only be run
      in parallel using MPI.  This is because of the way that the
      adjoint model is constructed.

  (6) Customize the configuration script "job_normalization.sh" and
      provide the appropriate place for the "substitute" Perl script:

      set SUBSTITUTE=${ROMS_ROOT}/ROMS/Bin/substitute

      This script is distributed with ROMS and it is found in the
      ROMS/Bin sub-directory. Alternatively, you can define
      ROMS_ROOT environmental variable in your .cshrc login
      script. For example, I have:

      setenv ROMS_ROOT ${HOME}/ocean/repository/trunk

  (7) Execute the configuration "job_normalization.sh" BEFORE
      running the model.  It copies the required files and
      creates "c4dvar.in" input script from template "s4dvar.in".

  (8) Run ROMS with data assimilation:

      mpirun -np 8 romsM roms_wc13.in > & log &

  (9) We recommend creating a new subdirectory "exact" or "random",
      and saving the solution in it for analysis and plotting to avoid
      overwriting output files when playing with difference CPP options
      and parameters. For example:

      mkdir exact
      mv Build_roms c4dvar.in *.nc log exact
      cp -p romsM roms_wc13.in exact

      The Normalization coefficients have been already computed for
      the WC13 application using the exact method.

 (10) Analyze the results using the plotting scripts (ROMS plotting
      package) provided in the ../plotting directory:

      ccnt_normalization_f.in      plots error covariance normalization
                                   coefficients for surface forcing

      ccnt_normalization_i.in      plots error covariance normalization
                                   coefficients for initial conditions
                                   at the surface or at z=-100m
