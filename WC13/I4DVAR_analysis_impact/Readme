   * Notice that this driver uses the following adjoint sensitivity

       DendS == 0.0d0                      ! ending day

       KendS == 30                         ! ending level

       Lstate(isUbar) == T                 ! 2D U-momentum
       Lstate(isVbar) == T                 ! 2D V-momentum
       Lstate(isUvel) == T                 ! 3D U-momentum
       Lstate(isVvel) == T                 ! 3D V-momentum

       Lstate(isTvar) == T T               ! tracers

   * Both FWDNAME and HISNAME must be the same:

       FWDNAME == wc13_fwd.nc
       HISNAME == wc13_fwd.nc

To run this application you need to take the following steps:

  (1) We need to run the model application for a period that is
      long enough to compute meaningful circulation statistics,
      like mean and standard deviations for all prognostic state
      variables (zeta, u, v, T, and S). The standard deviations
      are written to NetCDF files and are read by the 4D-Var
      algorithm to convert modeled error correlations to error
      covariances. The error covariance matrix, D, is very large
      and not well known. It is modeled as the solution of a
      diffusion equation as in Weaver and Courtier (2001).

      In this application, we need standard deviations for
      initial conditions, surface forcing (ADJUST_WSTRESS and
      ADJUST_STFLUX), and open boundary conditions (ADJUST_BOUNDARY).
      The standard deviations for the initial and open boundary
      conditions are in terms of the unbalanced error covariance
      (K Du K') since the balanced operator is activated
      (BALANCE_OPERATOR and ZETA_ELLIPTIC).

      The balance operator imposes a multivariate constraint on
      the error covariance such that the unobserved variable
      information is extracted from observed data by establishing
      balance relationships (i.e., T-S empirical formulas,
      hydrostactic balance, and geostrophic balance) with other
      state variables (Weaver et al., 2005).
   
      These standard deviations have already been created for you:

      ../Data/wc13_std_i.nc     initial conditions
      ../Data/wc13_std_b.nc     open boundary conditions
      ../Data/wc13_std_f.nc     surface forcing (wind stress and
                                                 net heat flux)

  (2) Since we are modeling the error covariance matrix, D, we
      need to compute the normalization coefficients to ensure
      that the diagonal elements of the associated correlation
      matrix C are equal to unity. There are two methods to
      compute normalization coefficients: exact and
      randomization (an approximation).

      The exact method is very expensive on large grids. The
      normalization coefficients are computed by perturbing
      each model grid cell with a delta function scaled by
      the area (2D state variables) or volume (3D state 
      variables), and then by convolving with the squared-root
      adjoint and tangent linear diffusion operators.

      The approximate method is cheaper: the normalization
      coefficients are computed using the randomization approach
      of Fisher and Courtier (1995). The coefficients are
      initialized with random numbers having a uniform distribution
      (drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and
      unit variance). Then, they are scaled by the inverse
      squared-root of the cell area (2D state variable) or volume
      (3D state variable) and convolved with the squared-root
      adjoint and tangent diffusion operators over a specified
      number of iterations, Nrandom.                      

      Check following parameters in the 4D-Var input script
      "s4dvar.in" (see input script for details):

      Nmethod  == 0             ! normalization method
      Nrandom  == 5000          ! randomization iterations

      LdefNRM == F F F F        ! Create a new normalization files
      LwrtNRM == F F F F        ! Compute and write normalization

      CnormI(isFsur) =  T       ! 2D variable at RHO-points
      CnormI(isUbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at U-points
      CnormI(isVbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at V-points 
      CnormI(isUvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at U-points
      CnormI(isVvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at V-points
      CnormI(isTvar) =  T T     ! NT tracers

      CnormB(isFsur) =  T       ! 2D variable at RHO-points
      CnormB(isUbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at U-points
      CnormB(isVbar) =  T       ! 2D variable at V-points
      CnormB(isUvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at U-points
      CnormB(isVvel) =  T       ! 3D variable at V-points
      CnormB(isTvar) =  T T     ! NT tracers

      CnormF(isUstr) =  T       ! surface U-momentum stress
      CnormF(isVstr) =  T       ! surface V-momentum stress
      CnormF(isTsur) =  T T     ! NT surface tracers flux

      These normalization coefficients have already been computed
      for you (../Normalization) using the exact method since this
      application has a small grid (54x53x30):

      ../Data/wc13_nrm_i.nc     initial conditions
      ../Data/wc13_nrm_b.nc     open boundary conditions
      ../Data/wc13_nrm_f.nc     surface forcing (wind stress and
                                                 net heat flux)

      Notice that the switches LdefNRM and LwrtNRM are all .FALSE.
      (F) since we already computed these coefficients.

      The normalization coefficients need to be computed only once
      for a particular application provided that the grid, land/sea
      masking (if any), and decorrelation scales (HdecayI, VdecayI,
      HdecayB, VdecayV, and HdecayF) remain the same. Notice that
      large spatial changes in the normalization coefficient
      structure are observed near the open boundaries and land/sea
      masking regions.

  (3) Before you run this application, you need to run the standard
      I4D-Var (../I4DVAR directory) since we need the Lanczos vectors.
      Notice that in "job_is4dvar_sen.sh" we have the following
      operation:

      cp -p ${Dir}/I4DVAR/wc13_adj_001.nc wc13_lcz.nc

      In I4D-Var, the Lanczos vectors are stored in the output adjoint
      NetCDF file "wc13_adj_001.nc".

  (4) In addition, to run this application you need an adjoint
      sensitivity functional. This is computed by the following
      Matlab script:

      ../Data/adsen_37N_transport.m

      which creates the NetCDF file "wc13_ads.nc". This file has
      already been created for you.

      The adjoint sensitivity functional is defined as the
      time-averaged transport crossing 37N in the upper 500m.

  (5) Customize your preferred "build_roms" script and provide the
      appropriate values for:

      * Root directory, MY_ROOT_DIR
      * ROMS source code, MY_ROMS_SRC
      * Fortran compiler, FORT
      * MPI flags, USE_MPI and USE_MPIF90
      * Path of MPI, NetCDF, and ARPACK libraries according to
        the compiler. Notice that you need to provide the
        correct places of these libraries for your computer.
        If you want to ignore this section, comment out the
        assignment for the variable USE_MY_LIBS.

  (6) Notice that the most important CPP options for this application
      are specified in the "build_roms" script instead of "wc13.h":

      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DI4DVAR_ANA_SENSITIVITY"
      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DAD_IMPULSE"
      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DOBS_IMPACT"
      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DOBS_IMPACT_SPLIT"

      this is to allow flexibility with different CPP options.

      For this to work, however, any "#undef" directives MUST be
      avoided in the header file "wc13.h" since it has precedence
      during C-preprocessing.

  (7) You MUST use the "build_roms" script to compile.

  (8) Customize the ROMS input script "roms_wc13.in" and specify
      the appropriate values for the distributed-memory partition.
      It is set by default to:

      NtileI == 2                               ! I-direction partition
      NtileJ == 4                               ! J-direction partition

      Notice that the adjoint-based algorithms can only be run
      in parallel using MPI.  This is because of the way that the
      adjoint model is constructed.

  (9) Customize the configuration script "job_i4dvar_sen.sh" and
      provide the appropriate place for the "substitute" Perl script:

      set SUBSTITUTE=${ROMS_ROOT}/ROMS/Bin/substitute

      This script is distributed with ROMS and it is found in the
      ROMS/Bin sub-directory. Alternatively, you can define
      ROMS_ROOT environmental variable in your .cshrc login
      script. For example, I have:

      setenv ROMS_ROOT ${HOME}/ocean/repository/trunk

 (10) Execute the configuration "job_i4dvar_sen.sh" BEFORE running
      the model.  It copies the required files and creates "i4dvar.in"
      input script from template "s4dvar.in". This has to be done
      EVERY TIME that you run this application. We need a clean and
      fresh copy of the initial conditions and observation files since
      they are modified by ROMS during execution.

 (11) Run ROMS with data assimilation:

      mpirun -np 8 romsM roms_wc13_daily.in > & log &

      or

      mpirun -np 8 romsM roms_wc13_2hours.in > & log &

      Notice that the nonlinear trajectory can be written either
      daily (NHIS=48 if using roms_wc13_daily.in) or every two-hours
      (NHIS=4 if using roms_wc13_2hours.in). It is the basic state
      trajectory used to linearize the tangent linear and adjoint
      models. It turns out that the daily sampling is over the
      limit where the tangent linear approximation is valid. The
      results are much better when using the two-hours snapshots.
      The two set-ups are provided to make the user aware of the
      validity of the tangent linear approximation in highly
      nonlinear circulations. The differences will be noticeable
      when computing observation impacts and observation sensitivities.

 (12) Analyze the results using the plotting Matlab script provided in
      the ../plotting directory:

      plot_i4dvar_impact.m         plots observation impact for
                                   I4D-Var
